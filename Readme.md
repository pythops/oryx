To build `oryx`:

#### 1. Install Rust nightly toolchain

```
rustup toolchain install nightly --component rust-src
```

#### 2. Install [bpf-linker](https://github.com/aya-rs/bpf-linker)

##### For `x86_64`

Simply run the following command:

```
cargo install bpf-linker
```

##### For `arm64`

For Debian based distributions, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `llvm-19`
- `llvm-19-dev`
- `libpolly-19-dev`

then run the following command:

```
cargo install bpf-linker --no-default-features
```

> Check [bpf-linker Installation section](https://github.com/aya-rs/bpf-linker?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for more infos.

#### 3. Build

```
cargo xtask build --release
```

This will produce an executable file at `target/release/oryx` that you can copy to a directory in your `$PATH`.
